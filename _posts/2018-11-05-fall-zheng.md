desc: "Venice, California, has recently evolved from a boutique-focused art center to a popular commerce, as a result of increasing rates of tourism. This has resulted in a major conflict, driven mostly by gentrification and there are clear gaps in demographic factors such as race and class. There needs to be resolutions set in place, or else Venice will lose its unique bohemian culture to the corporate masses."

Much like its counterpart in Europe, the Venice of California must undergo a renaissance in an attempt to find its true identity. Long known as “The Slum by the Sea” because of the shacks and simple bungalows that hosted many destitute constituents, it has since transformed into a tourist and entertainment center primarily catering to people of high status. This has created conflict between the original citizens of Venice and the newcomers who are not only racially different but also possessing more wealth and demanding a culture change. The artsy beach culture of Venice is threatened to disappear without major intervention from the proper authorities and resolve from all parties of the ensuing conflict. This evolution can be traced to when Venice was just a boutique-focused art center only populated by the likes of artists and those of eclectic nature. When GQ Magazine recognized Abbott Kinney Boulevard as the “coolest block in America” in 2012, the inflow of wealthy tourists created an uneasy equilibrium between long-time locals and prominent newcomers. The wealth disparity and racial differences led to gentrification and even the economic viability of the town is now being questioned as sky-rocketing price of rent clashes with long-established cultural enclaves. There is a general consensus that change is needed in Venice in order to resolve the ever-widening gap between different demographics and become a cultural center that truly lives up to its namesake.

Venice, California was founded in the early 1900s in order to fulfill a vision of a better place of higher learning and health benefits. Abbot Kinney, the city’s founder, wanted intellectuals to come and pursue their dreams while enjoying the ocean air. However, the people of Venice decided they’d rather have amusement parks and carnivals, and Kinney gave in to their wishes. This proved untenable and following Kinney’s death in 1920, “Venice voted to become a part of the City of Los Angeles” (“Venice California History”). Venice was later transformed by the discovery of oil and known as the “Slum by the Sea” when oil prospects died down and enterprising discoverers became poor settlers. This moniker remained until the 1950s, where bodybuilding became all the rage. In the 1970s, Venice was flooded with all sorts of people, “a culture of artists, musicians, and poets [led by cheap rent and vibe of individuality] (“Venice California History”). The birth of this culture proved instrumental for the diversity of Venice and helped establish Venice as a beach town for artist newcomers and enterprising folks. Not only that, the infusion of culture as a result of these newcomers provided an unique vibe of street art and the creation of the Venice Boardwalk only helped everyone experience the distinct way of life there. However, this changed for the worse once Venice was plopped straight into GQ Magazine.
   
Abbot Kinney Boulevard was named the “coolest block of America” in the GQ Magazine in 2012. The fame from the magazine propelled Venice, California to the forefront of wealthy Americans’ minds and only exacerbated the rising prices for real estate and tourist activity that were already in place. Venice became a brand, attracting top notch technology companies and famous Hollywood actors and actresses. One of these companies was Google, well known for its search engine and various other products for consumers. The new campus housed “about 500 Google employees in the Frank Gehry-designed building at 340 Main St.” and it allowed Google to close previous locations in Santa Monica, allowing for a more unified team in the Los Angeles area (Page). Alongside Snap Inc., the creator of the powerhouse app Snapchat, and other prominent companies, Venice suddenly became known as “Silicon Beach.” Abbot Kinney Boulevard was also transformed as global names moved in to take over once-local establishments. The transformation can also be seen in drastic real estate price changes. Back “In 1996, according to data provided by Zillow, the average home value in Venice was $251,000 […] Today, Venice’s average home value is nearly $1.6 million” (Aron). A five-fold price increase is only one of the changes observed when a humble beach town turns into a major tourist attraction. It means that housing supply has stayed constant while demand has grown exponentially and that commercial developers are salivating at the idea of new projects in Venice, California. Many long-time locals have felt the burden as expenses soared and can no longer afford to stay in the place they call home. Clearly, the revamp of Venice as a town has come at the cost of racial and class inclusiveness. 


Spaces will work.

Indents do not, so just put a space in for each new paragraph.

Formating is very simple in this document. 

To add an image you will use an exclamation point, then a description in brackets, and then the location of the image in parentheses. We will try to store ALL of our images in the GitHub repository.  There is also a little bit of text after the image in the special curly brackets and the word image inside it. Leave this alone! It displays the image in a special viewer so when you click on the image it opens it up in its own viewer and then you can cycle through all the images in this viewer. You can put in as many images as you like. Just always make sure to have the curly brackets afterwards.
